# clio

Clio automates searaching git history to determine what bug fixes went in to a given release.

It currently understand the following formats in commit notes:

```
https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=####
bugzilla ####
bug ####
fix ####
bxc ####

with an optional # before the number for the last four.
```

and will cross reference bugzilla to verify the existance of referenced bugs when possible.

## Building

```
make prepare
make release
```

The contents of dist are relocatable where ever you desire.

## Quickstart

```
./dist/clio [ACTION] [OPTIONS] PATH_TO_GIT_CHECKOUT
```

## Examples:

**What bugs were fixed after a given hash**:

``` --oldest:bcfddc9 clio-test-data/```

**What mono bugs were fixed in a release branch (clio currently does not understand tags)**:

```--list-bugs --oldest:`git rev-list -1 mono-5.2.0.213` --newest:origin/2017-04 mono/```

**What bugs were fixed after d15-3 branched to current d15-4, excluding cherry picks to d15-3, including submodule bumped**:

```--list-bugs --submodules --oldest-branch:d15-3 --newest=d15-4 xamarin-macios```


## Actions

The two current actions (beyond help) are:

- list-commits: List the commits that are under consideration based upon the path given, --oldest, and --newest
- list-bugs: Print a markdown formatted table of the bugs found in the commit range in question. A secondary set of "potential" bugs may come after, which will require manual verification.

## Bugzilla Validation

By default, clio will contact bugzilla.xamarin.com and verify potential bugs against the public bug list. This takes significant amount of time, but reduces false positives and provides better title information in many cases.

Two additional options can change this behavor (beyond --bugzilla:public which is default)

- --bugzilla:private - Log into bugzilla with credentials stored in ~/.bugzilla or the ```BUGZILLA_LOGIN``` ```BUGZILLA_PASSWORD``` environmental variables, which allows private bugs to be listed and verified
- --bugzilla:disable - Disable all bugzilla validation. Will drastically improve speed but may reduce bug sorting quality.

By default bugzilla valiation is set to public, which means private bugs will be called out as "Potential bugs". Additionally, they will not have bugzilla titles added as additional descriptions to choose from in bug listings. This may be desired behavior, if private bugs are not considered release notes appropriate. This behavior can be changed with the aforementioned ```--bugzilla:private``` option.
