- Emit the bugzilla status and milestone would be handy
- Recursively check submodules based on snapshot of what submodules hash was at oldest to newest?

- Handle branches instead of hashes (walk up to commit parent?)
- Look at something for feature PRs?

- Be able to update existing? (Handled for now by printing bug table)
